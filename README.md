# ðŸŽ¬ clipper
A simple screen gif recording program.   

The no-gui version of clipper is a simple, light weight, and dumbed down version of the standard version  

Simply run the exe and follow the instructions.

Currently clips are 5 seconds recorded at 30 fps and half-resolution. More flexability in the future.
